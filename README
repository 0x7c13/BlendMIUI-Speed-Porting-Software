This is a short program trying to help you guys to build your own BlendMIUI automatically in just few minutes.The software itself contains major CM7 rebuilted sources for MIUI porting(Arc & Neo).I rebuilted CM7 and kernel by using the way provided by bheremans.BlendMIUI kernel is based on FXP & SEMC kernel sources which I have been uploaded to Github.CM7 sources for Xperia Ray ST18i are come from bheremans' MIUI ROM.


Before running the software you should install JAVA-SE-JRE to make sure it works fine.

Support Devices: Xperia Arc,Xperia Arc S,Xperia Neo,Xperia Neo V,Xperia Ray,Xperia Play.
