Progress: 5.Help yourself.

Now your device has entered into CWM-Recovery
Please Choose:
"apply update from sdcard"->"Install /sdcard/update.zip"
to flash rom then reboot.

Hint:Auto-Flash is done!!!
P.S:Since I don't know how to use extended command to let CWM 5.0 flash update.zip automatically,Auto-Flash is done here.
If you have any idea using extended command to control CWM-recovery 5.0,please tell me:)

Press any key to quit.
